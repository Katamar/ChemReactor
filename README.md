# ChemReactor
Molecular simulation software that captures the spatio-temporal and chemical dynamics of the system. Can simulate different polymerization mechanisms (dimerization, bimolecular reaction, step-growth and chain-growth polymerization...). A combination of stochastic kinetics and stochastic dynamics (Langevin dynamics).
